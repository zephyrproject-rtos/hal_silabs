///
/// To configure IEEE 802.15.4 functionality, the application must first set up
/// a RAIL instance with \ref sl_rail_init() and other setup functions.

///
/// 802.15.4 defines its macAckWaitDuration from the end of the transmitted
/// packet to complete reception of the Ack. RAIL's ack_timeout_us only covers
/// sync word detection of the Ack. Therefore, subtract the Ack's
/// PHY header and payload time to get RAIL's ack_timeout_us setting.
/// For 2.4 GHz OQPSK, macAckWaitDuration is specified as 54 symbols;

 * The application is expected to handle this event by calling \ref

 * - If an Immediate Ack, determine Frame Pending needs based on the packet

 *   be sent. If not called in time, \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_TXACK_UNDERFLOW will

 *   Note that if 802.15.4 MAC-level encryption is used with Version 2
