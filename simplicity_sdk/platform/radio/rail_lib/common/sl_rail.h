/// context, leave the cb parameter passed to \ref sl_rail_set_timer() as NULL and poll

 * Sleep APIs
 *****************************************************************************/
/// @addtogroup Sleep
/// @brief These APIs help when putting the system to an EM2/EM3/EM4 sleep
/// states where the high frequency clock is disabled.
/// @{
///
/// The RAIL library has its own timebase and the ability to schedule operations
/// into the future. When going to any power mode that disables the HF clock
/// used for the radio (EM2/EM3/EM4), it is important that this timebase is
/// synchronized to a running LFCLK and the chip is set to wake up before the
/// next scheduled event.
/// If RAIL has not been configured to use the power manager,
/// \ref sl_rail_sleep() and \ref sl_rail_wake() must be called for performing this
/// synchronization.
/// If RAIL has been configured to use the power manager,
/// \ref sl_rail_init_power_manager(), it will automatically perform timer
/// synchronization based on the selected \ref sl_rail_timer_sync_config_t. Calls to
/// \ref sl_rail_sleep() and \ref sl_rail_wake() are unsupported in such a scenario.
///
/// Following example code snippets demonstrate synchronizing the timebase
/// with and without timer synchronization:
///
/// <b>Sleep with timer synchronization:</b>
///
/// When sleeping with timer synchronization, you must first get the required
/// LFCLK up and running and leave it running across sleep so that the high
/// frequency clock that drives the RAIL time base can be synchronized to it.
/// The \ref sl_rail_sleep() API will also set up a wake event on the timer to wake
/// up wakeup_process_time_us before the next timer event so that it can run successfully.
/// See the \ref efr32_main sections on Low-Frequency Clocks and RAIL Timer
/// Synchronization for more setup details.
///
/// This is useful when maintaining packet timestamps
/// across sleep or use the scheduled RX/TX APIs while sleeping in between. It
/// does take more time and code to do the synchronization. If your
/// application does not need this, it should be avoided.
///
/// Example (without Power Manager):
/// @code{.c}
/// #include "sl_rail.h"
///
/// extern sl_rail_handle_t rail_handle;
/// // Wakeup time for your crystal/board/chip combination
/// extern uint32_t wakeup_process_time_us;

/// RAIL APIs such as, \ref sl_rail_start_scheduled_tx(), \ref sl_rail_start_scheduled_rx(),
/// \ref sl_rail_set_timer(), \ref sl_rail_set_multi_timer() can be used to schedule periodic
/// wakeups to perform a scheduled operation. The call to
/// sl_power_manager_sleep() in the main loop ensures that the device sleeps
/// until the scheduled operation is due.
/// Upon completion, each instantaneous or scheduled RX/TX operation will
/// indicate radio busy to the power manager to allow the application to
/// service the RAIL event and perform subsequent operations before going to
/// sleep. Therefore, it is important that the application idle the radio by either
/// calling \ref sl_rail_idle() or \ref sl_rail_yield_radio().
/// If the radio transitions to RX after an RX or TX operation,
/// always call \ref sl_rail_idle() in order transition to a lower sleep state.
/// If the radio transitions to idle after an RX or TX operation,
/// \ref sl_rail_yield_radio() should suffice in indicating to the power manager
/// that the radio is no longer busy and the device can sleep.
///
/// The following example shows scheduling periodic TX on getting a TX completion
/// event:
/// @code{.c}
/// void rail_events_callback(sl_rail_handle_t rail_handle, sl_rail_events_t events)
/// {
///   // Omitting other event handlers
///   if (events & SL_RAIL_EVENTS_TX_COMPLETION) {
///     // Schedule the next TX.
///     sl_rail_scheduled_tx_config_t config = {
///       .when = (sl_rail_time_t)parameters->start_time,
///       .mode = (sl_rail_time_mode_t)parameters->start_time_mode
///     };
///     (void)sl_rail_start_scheduled_tx(rail_handle, channel, 0, &config, NULL);
///   }
/// }
/// @endcode
///
/// @note The above code assumes that RAIL automatic state transitions after TX
///   are idle. Use \ref sl_rail_set_tx_transitions() to ensure the right state
///   transitions are used. Radio must be idle for the device to enter EM2 or lower
///   energy mode.
///
/// @note When using the power manager, usage of \ref sl_rail_yield_radio() in
///   single protocol RAIL is similar to its usage in multiprotocol RAIL.
///   See \ref rail_radio_scheduler_yield for more details.
///
/// @note Back to back scheduled operations do not require an explicit call to
///   \ref sl_rail_yield_radio() if the radio transitions to idle.
///
/// <b>Sleep without timer synchronization:</b>
///
/// When sleeping without timer synchronization, you are free to enable only the
/// LFCLKs and wake sources required by the application. RAIL will not attempt
/// to configure any wake events and may miss anything that occurs over sleep.

/// This is useful when your application does not care about

 *****************************************************************************/
/// @addtogroup Data_Management Data Management
/// @brief Data management functions
///
/// These functions allow the application to choose how data is presented to
/// the application. RAIL provides data in a packet-based method or in a
/// FIFO-based method. As originally conceived,
/// \ref sl_rail_data_method_t::SL_RAIL_DATA_METHOD_PACKET_MODE was designed for handling packets
/// that fit within RAIL's FIFOs while \ref sl_rail_data_method_t::SL_RAIL_DATA_METHOD_FIFO_MODE
/// was designed for handling packets larger than RAIL's FIFOs could hold.
/// Conceptually it is still useful to think of these modes this way, but
/// functionally their distinction has become blurred by improvements in
/// RAIL's flexibility -- applications now have much more control over both
/// receive and transmit FIFO sizes, and the FIFO-management and threshold
/// APIs and related events are no longer restricted to \ref
/// sl_rail_data_method_t::SL_RAIL_DATA_METHOD_FIFO_MODE operation but can be used in \ref
/// sl_rail_data_method_t::SL_RAIL_DATA_METHOD_PACKET_MODE too.
///
/// The application can configure RAIL data management through \ref
/// sl_rail_config_tx_data() and \ref sl_rail_config_rx_data(). These functions allows the
/// application to specify the type of radio data (\ref sl_rail_tx_data_source_t
/// and \ref sl_rail_rx_data_source_t) and the method of interacting with data
/// (\ref sl_rail_data_method_t). By default, RAIL configures TX and RX both
/// with packet data source and \ref sl_rail_data_method_t::SL_RAIL_DATA_METHOD_PACKET_MODE.
///
/// For transmit, \ref sl_rail_data_method_t::SL_RAIL_DATA_METHOD_PACKET_MODE and \ref
/// sl_rail_data_method_t::SL_RAIL_DATA_METHOD_FIFO_MODE are functionally the same:
///   - When not actively transmitting, load a packet's initial transmit
///     data using \ref sl_rail_write_tx_fifo() with reset set to true. Alternatively
///     this data copying can be avoided by changing the transmit FIFO to an
///     already-loaded section of memory with \ref sl_rail_set_tx_fifo().
///   - When actively transmitting, load remaining transmit data with
///     \ref sl_rail_write_tx_fifo() with reset set to false.
///   - If transmit packets exceed the FIFO size, set the transmit FIFO
///     threshold through \ref sl_rail_set_tx_fifo_threshold(). The \ref
///     sl_rail_config_t::events_callback with \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_TX_FIFO_ALMOST_EMPTY
///     will occur telling the application to load more TX packet data, if
///     needed, to prevent a \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_TX_UNDERFLOW event from occurring.
///     One can get how much space is available in the transmit FIFO for more
///     transmit data through \ref sl_rail_get_tx_fifo_space_available().
///   - After transmit completes, the transmit FIFO can be manually reset
///     with \ref sl_rail_reset_fifo(), but this should rarely be necessary.
///
/// The transmit FIFO is specified by the application and its size is
/// the value returned from the most recent call to \ref sl_rail_set_tx_fifo().
/// The transmit FIFO is edge-based in that it only provides the \ref
/// SL_RAIL_EVENT_TX_FIFO_ALMOST_EMPTY event once when the threshold is crossed
/// in the emptying direction.
///
/// For receive, the distinction between \ref sl_rail_data_method_t::SL_RAIL_DATA_METHOD_PACKET_MODE
/// and \ref sl_rail_data_method_t::SL_RAIL_DATA_METHOD_FIFO_MODE basically boils down to how
/// unsuccessfully-received packets are handled. In \ref
/// sl_rail_data_method_t::SL_RAIL_DATA_METHOD_PACKET_MODE, data from such packets is automatically
/// rolled back as if the packet was never received, while in \ref
/// sl_rail_data_method_t::SL_RAIL_DATA_METHOD_FIFO_MODE, rollback does not occur putting more onus
/// on the application to deal with that data.
///
/// In receive \ref sl_rail_data_method_t::SL_RAIL_DATA_METHOD_PACKET_MODE data management:
///   - Packet lengths are determined from the Radio Configurator configuration
///     and can be read out at the end using \ref sl_rail_get_rx_packet_info().
///   - Received packet data is made available on successful packet completion
///     via \ref sl_rail_config_t::events_callback with \ref
///     SL_RAIL_EVENT_RX_PACKET_RECEIVED which can then use \ref sl_rail_get_rx_packet_info()
///     and \ref sl_rail_get_rx_packet_details() to access packet information and
///     \ref sl_rail_peek_rx_packet() to access packet data.
///   - FILTERED, ABORTED, or FRAMEERROR received packet data is automatically
///     rolled back (dropped) without the application needing to worry about
///     consuming it.
///     The application can choose to not even be bothered with the events
///     related to such packets: \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_RX_ADDRESS_FILTERED,
///     \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_RX_PACKET_ABORTED, or \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_RX_FRAME_ERROR.
///
/// In receive \ref sl_rail_data_method_t::SL_RAIL_DATA_METHOD_FIFO_MODE data management:
///   - Packet Lengths are determined from the Radio Configurator configuration
///     or by application knowledge of packet payload structure.
///   - Received data can be retrieved prior to packet completion through
///     \ref sl_rail_read_rx_fifo() and is never rolled back on FILTERED, ABORTED, or
///     FRAMEERROR packets. The application should enable and handle these
///     events so it can flush any packet data it's already retrieved.
///   - After packet completion, remaining packet data for FILTERED, ABORTED,

///     callback all remaining data in the FIFO will be cleaned up as usual.
///     Keep in mind that \ref sl_rail_get_rx_packet_details() provides full packet
///     detailed information only for successfully received packets.
///
/// Common receive data management features:
///   - Set the receive FIFO threshold through \ref sl_rail_set_rx_fifo_threshold(). The
///     \ref sl_rail_config_t::events_callback with \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_ALMOST_FULL
///     will occur telling the application to consume some RX packet data to
///     prevent a \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_OVERFLOW event from occurring.
///   - Get receive FIFO count information through
///     \ref sl_rail_get_rx_packet_info(\ref SL_RAIL_RX_PACKET_HANDLE_NEWEST)
///     (or \ref sl_rail_get_rx_fifo_bytes_available()).
///   - After receive completes and all its data has been consumed, the receive
///     FIFO and associated receive Packet Queue can be manually reset with
///     \ref sl_rail_reset_fifo(), though this should rarely be necessary and should
///     only be done with the radio idle.
///
/// When trying to determine an appropriate threshold, the application needs
/// to know the size of each FIFO. This can be obtained via \ref
/// sl_rail_get_config() if not already known. The receive FIFO event is
/// level-based in that the \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_ALMOST_FULL event will
/// constantly pend if the threshold is exceeded. This normally means that
/// inside this event's callback, the application should empty enough of the FIFO
/// to go under the threshold. To defer reading the FIFO to main context, the
/// application can disable or re-enable the receive FIFO threshold event using
/// \ref sl_rail_config_events() with the mask \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_ALMOST_FULL.
///
/// The receive FIFO can store multiple packets and processing of a packet can
/// be deferred from the RAIL event callback to main-loop processing
/// by using \ref sl_rail_hold_rx_packet() in the event callback and
/// \ref sl_rail_release_rx_packet() in the main-loop.
/// The receive FIFO is supplemented by the receive Packet Queue that limits
/// the number of packets RAIL and applications can hold onto for deferred
/// processing.
///
/// @note When using multiprotocol, if a protocol's receive FIFO or
///   receive Packet Queue is shared with another protocol, they will be reset
///   during a protocol switch so held packets will be lost if not processed
///   before then.
///
/// While \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_ALMOST_FULL occurs solely based on the
/// state of the receive FIFO used for packet data, both
/// \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_FULL and \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_OVERFLOW
/// can occur coincident with packet completion when either that or the
/// receive Packet Queue fills or overflows.
/// \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_FULL informs the application it should
/// immediately process and free up the oldest packets/data to make room
/// for new packets/data, reducing the possibility of packet/data loss
/// and \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_OVERFLOW.
///
/// Before a packet is fully received you can always use \ref
/// sl_rail_peek_rx_packet() to look at the contents. In FIFO mode, you may also
/// consume its data with \ref sl_rail_read_rx_fifo(). Remember that none of these
/// APIs will read across a packet boundary (even in FIFO mode) so you will
/// need to handle each received packet individually.
///
/// While RAIL defaults to \ref sl_rail_data_method_t::SL_RAIL_DATA_METHOD_PACKET_MODE, the
/// application can explicitly initialize RAIL for \ref
/// sl_rail_data_method_t::SL_RAIL_DATA_METHOD_PACKET_MODE in the following manner:

 *
 * This function configures how RAIL manages RX data. The application can
 * configure RAIL to receive data in a packet-based or FIFO-based manner.
 * \ref sl_rail_data_method_t::SL_RAIL_DATA_METHOD_FIFO_MODE is necessary to receive packets larger
 * than the radio's receive FIFO. It is also required for receive data
 * sources other than \ref sl_rail_rx_data_source_t::SL_RAIL_RX_DATA_SOURCE_PACKET_DATA.
 *
 * Generally with \ref sl_rail_data_method_t::SL_RAIL_DATA_METHOD_FIFO_MODE, the
 * application sets an appropriate FIFO threshold via
 * \ref sl_rail_set_rx_fifo_threshold() and then enables and handles the \ref
 * SL_RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_ALMOST_FULL event callback (to consume packet data
 * via \ref sl_rail_read_rx_fifo() before the receive FIFO overflows).

 * function will reset the corresponding FIFO thresholds such that they
 * won't trigger \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_ALMOST_FULL events.
 *
 * When \ref sl_rail_rx_data_config_t::rx_method is set to \ref
 * sl_rail_data_method_t::SL_RAIL_DATA_METHOD_FIFO_MODE, the radio won't drop packet data of
 * aborted or CRC error packets, but will present it to the application
 * to deal with accordingly. On completion of erroneous packets, the
 * \ref sl_rail_config_t::events_callback with \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_RX_PACKET_ABORTED,
 * \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_RX_FRAME_ERROR, or \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_RX_ADDRESS_FILTERED will
 * tell the application it can drop any data it read via \ref sl_rail_read_rx_fifo() during reception.
 * For CRC error packets when the \ref SL_RAIL_RX_OPTION_IGNORE_CRC_ERRORS
 * RX option is in effect, the application should check for that from the
 * \ref sl_rail_rx_packet_status_t obtained by calling \ref sl_rail_get_rx_packet_info().
 * RAIL will automatically flush any remaining packet data after reporting
 * one of these packet completion events or the application can explicitly
 * flush it by calling \ref sl_rail_release_rx_packet().
 *
 * When \ref sl_rail_rx_data_config_t::rx_method is set to \ref
 * sl_rail_data_method_t::SL_RAIL_DATA_METHOD_PACKET_MODE, the radio will roll back (drop) all packet
 * data associated with aborted packets including those with CRC errors
 * (unless configured to ignore CRC errors via the
 * \ref SL_RAIL_RX_OPTION_IGNORE_CRC_ERRORS RX option). The application will
 * never have to deal with packet data from these packets.
 * In either mode, the application can set RX options as needed.
 *
 * When \ref sl_rail_rx_data_config_t::rx_source is set to a value other than
 * \ref SL_RAIL_RX_DATA_SOURCE_PACKET_DATA and \ref sl_rail_config_t::events_callback
 * \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_OVERFLOW is enabled RX will be terminated
 * if a RX FIFO overflow occurs. If \ref SL_RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_OVERFLOW
 * is not enabled, data will be discarded until the overflow condition

/// @addtogroup PA Power Amplifier (PA)
/// @brief APIs for interacting with one of the on chip PAs.
///
/// These APIs let you configure the on-chip PA to get the appropriate output
/// power.
///
/// These are the function types:
///   1) Configuration functions: These functions set and get configuration
///      for the PA. In this case, "configuration" refers to a) indicating
///      which PA to use, b) the voltage supplied by your board to the PA,
///      and c) the ramp time over which to ramp the PA up to its full
///      power.
///   2) Power-setting functions: These functions consume the actual
///      values written to the PA registers and write them appropriately.
///      These values are referred to as "(raw) power levels". The range of
///      acceptable values for these functions depends on which PA is
///      currently active. The higher the power level set, the higher
///      the dBm power output by the radio. However, the mapping
///      between dBm and these power levels can vary greatly between
///      modules/boards.
///   3) Conversion functions: These functions convert
///      between the "power levels" discussed previously and the
///      dBm values output by the radio. Continue reading for more information
///      about unit conversion.
///
/// The accuracy of the radio output power is application-specific.
/// For some protocols or channels, the protocol itself or
/// legal limitations require applications to know exactly what power
/// they're transmitting at, in dBm. Other applications do not have
/// these restrictions, and users determine power level(s)
/// that fit their criteria for the trade-off between radio range and
/// power savings, regardless of what dBm power that maps to.
///
/// \ref sl_rail_util_pa_convert_raw_to_dbm() and \ref sl_rail_util_pa_convert_dbm_to_raw(),
/// which convert between the dBm power and the raw power levels,
/// provide a solution that fits all these applications.
/// The levels of customization are outlined below:
///  1) No customization needed: for a given dBm value, the result
///     of \ref sl_rail_util_pa_convert_dbm_to_raw() provides an appropriate
///     raw power level that, when written to the registers via
///     \ref sl_rail_set_tx_power(), causes the radio to output at that
///     dBm power. In this case, no action is needed by the user,
///     the WEAK versions of the conversion functions can be used
///     and the default include paths in pa_conversions_efr32.h can
///     be used.
///  2) The mapping of power level to dBm is not ideal, but the
///     level of precision is sufficient: In pa_conversions_efr32.c,
///     the WEAK versions of the conversion functions work by using
///     8-segment piecewise linear curves to convert between dBm
///     and power levels for PA's with hundreds of power levels
///     and simple mapping tables for use with PA's with only a few
///     levels. If this method is sufficiently precise, but the mapping
///     between power levels and dBm is incorrect,
///     copy pa_curves_efr32.h into a new file, updating the segments
///     to form a better fit (_DCDC_CURVES or _VBAT_CURVES defines) and
///     then add the SL_RAIL_PA_CURVES define to your build with the path
///     to the new file.
///  3) A different level of precision is needed and the fit is bad:
///     If the piecewise-linear line segment fit is not appropriate for
///     your solution, the functions in pa_conversions_efr32.c can be
///     totally rewritten, as long as \ref sl_rail_util_pa_convert_dbm_to_raw() and
///     \ref sl_rail_util_pa_convert_raw_to_dbm() have the same signatures. It is completely
///     acceptable to re-write these in a way that makes the
///     pa_curves_efr32.h and pa_curve_types_efr32.h files referenced in
///     pa_conversions_efr32.h unnecessary. Those files are needed solely
///     for the provided conversion methods.
///  4) dBm values are not necessary: If the application does not require
///     dBm values at all, overwrite \ref
///     sl_rail_util_pa_convert_dbm_to_raw() and \ref sl_rail_util_pa_convert_raw_to_dbm() with smaller functions
///     (i.e., return 0 or whatever was input). These functions are called
///     from within the RAIL library, so they can never be deadstripped,
///     but making them as small as possible is the best way to reduce code
///     size. From there, call \ref sl_rail_set_tx_power(), without
///     converting from a dBm value. To stop the library from coercing the
///     power based on channels, overwrite \ref sl_rail_util_pa_convert_raw_to_dbm()
///     to always return 0 and overwrite \ref sl_rail_util_pa_convert_dbm_to_raw() to
///     always return 255.
///
/// The following is example code that shows how to initialize your PA
/// @code{.c}
/// #include "sl_pa_conversions_efr32.h"
///
/// // A macro SL_RAIL_TX_POWER_CURVES_CONFIG is used as the curve
/// // structures used by the provided conversion functions.
/// sl_rail_tx_power_curves_config_t tx_power_curves_config = SL_RAIL_TX_POWER_CURVES_CONFIG;
/// // Saves those curves
/// // to be referenced when the conversion functions are called.
/// sl_rail_init_tx_power_curves(rail_handle, &tx_power_curves_config);
///

/// sl_rail_tx_power_config_t tx_power_config = {
///   .mode         = SL_RAIL_TX_POWER_MODE_2P4_GHZ_HP,

///

/// // that has already been initialized.
/// sl_rail_config_tx_power(rail_handle, &tx_power_config);
///
/// // Picks a dBm power to use: 100 deci-dBm = 10 dBm. See docs on sl_rail_tx_power_t.

 * Address Filtering (RX)
 *****************************************************************************/
/**
 * @addtogroup Address_Filtering Address Filtering
 * @brief Configuration APIs for receive packet address filtering.
 *
 * The address filtering code examines the packet as follows.
 *
 * | `Bytes: 0 - 255` |  `0 - 8`  | `0 - 255` |  `0 - 8`  | `Variable` |
 * |:----------------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|:----------:|
 * | `Data_0`         | `Field_0` | `Data_1`  | `Field_1` | `Data_2`   |
 *
 * In the above structure, anything listed as Data_# is an optional section of
 * bytes that RAIL will not process for address filtering. The Field_# segments
 * reference specific sections in the packet that will each be interpreted
 * as an address during address filtering. The application may submit up to
 * four addresses to attempt to match each field segment and each address may
 * have a size of up to 8 bytes. To set up address filtering, first configure
 * the locations and length of the addresses in the packet. Next, configure
 * which combinations of matches in Field_0 and Field_1 should constitute an
 * address match. Last, enter addresses into tables for each field and
 * enable them. The first two of these are part of the \ref sl_rail_addr_config_t
 * structure while the second part is configured at runtime using the
 * \ref sl_rail_set_address_filter_address() API. A brief description of each
 * configuration is listed below.
 *
 * The offsets and sizes of the fields
 * are assumed fixed for the RAIL address filter. To set them, specify
 * arrays for these values in the sizes and offsets entries in the
 * \ref sl_rail_addr_config_t structure. A size of zero indicates that a field is
 * disabled. The start offset for a field is relative to the previous start
 * offset and, if you're using frame type decoding, the first start offset is
 * relative to the end of the byte containing the frame type.
 *
 * Configuring which combinations of Field_0 and Field_1 constitute a match is
 * the most complex portion of the address filter. The easiest way to think
 * about this is with a truth table. If you consider each of the four possible
 * address entries in a field, you can have a match on any one of those or a
 * match for none of them. This is shown in the 5x5 truth table below where
 * Field_0 matches are the rows and Field_1 matches are the columns.
 *
 * |                | No Match | Address 0 | Address 1 | Address 2 | Address 3 |
 * |----------------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
 * | __No Match__   | bit 0    | bit 1     | bit 2     | bit 3     | bit 4     |
 * | __Address 0__  | bit 5    | bit 6     | bit 7     | bit 8     | bit 9     |
 * | __Address 1__  | bit 10   | bit 11    | bit 12    | bit 13    | bit 14    |
 * | __Address 2__  | bit 15   | bit 16    | bit 17    | bit 18    | bit 19    |
 * | __Address 3__  | bit 20   | bit 21    | bit 22    | bit 23    | bit 24    |
 *
 * Because this is only 25 bits, it can be represented in one 32-bit integer
 * where 1 indicates a filter pass and 0 indicates a filter fail. This is the
 * \ref sl_rail_addr_config_t::match_table field and is used during
 * filtering. For common simple configurations, two defines are provided with
 * the truth tables as shown below. The first is \ref
 * SL_RAIL_ADDR_CONFIG_MATCH_TABLE_SINGLE_FIELD, which can be used if only using
 * one address field (either field). If using two fields and want to
 * force in the same address entry in each field, use the second define: \ref
 * SL_RAIL_ADDR_CONFIG_MATCH_TABLE_DOUBLE_FIELD. For more complex systems,
 * create a valid custom table.
 *
 * @note Address filtering does not function reliably with PHYs that use a data
 *   rate greater than 500 kbps. If this is a requirement, filtering must
 *   currently be done by the application.

/// The converse is also true, if the frame length is configured to be a fixed
/// 10-byte packet but only 5 bytes are loaded into the Ack buffer, a TX

///
/// Unlike in non-Auto-Ack mode, Auto-Ack mode will always return to a single

///
/// When \ref Antenna_Control is used for multiple antennas, Acks are
/// transmitted on the antenna that was selected to receive the packet
/// being acknowledged. When receiving an Ack, the
/// \ref sl_rail_rx_options_t antenna options are used just like for any other

///
/// If the Ack payload is dynamic, the application must call \ref

/**
 * @addtogroup Rx_Channel_Hopping RX Channel Hopping
 * @brief Hardware accelerated hopping between channels while waiting for a
 *   packet in receive.
 * @{
 *
 * Channel hopping provides a hardware accelerated method for
 * scanning across multiple channels quickly, as part of a receive protocol.
 * While it is possible to call \ref sl_rail_start_rx() on different channels,
 * back to back, and listen on many channels sequentially in that way, the
 * time it takes to switch channels with that method may be too long for some
 * protocols. This API pre-computes necessary channel change operations
 * for a given list of channels, so that the radio can move from channel
 * to channel much faster. Additionally, it leads to more succinct code
 * as channel changes will be done implicitly, without requiring numerous calls
 * to \ref sl_rail_start_rx(). Currently, while this feature is enabled, the radio
 * will hop channels in the given sequence each time it enters RX.
 * Note that RX Channel hopping and EFR32xG25's concurrent mode / collision
 * detection are mutually exclusive.
 *
 * The channel hopping buffer requires \ref SL_RAIL_CHANNEL_HOPPING_BUFFER_WORDS_PER_CHANNEL
 * number of 32-bit words of overhead per channel, plus 3 words overall plus the
 * twice the size of the \ref sl_rail_channel_config_t::phy_config_delta_subtract
 * of the whole radio configuration, plus the twice the sum of the sizes of all
 * the \ref sl_rail_channel_config_entry_t::phy_config_delta_add inall the channel
 * hopping channels.
 *
 * The following code gives an example of how to use
 * the RX Channel Hopping API.

 * RAIL internally calls platform functions that access CMU, EMU, GPIO, LDMA
 * HFXO and PRS.
 * If some of them are configured as secure peripherals, some functions must be
 * executed as secure code. To do so, those functions are prepended with weak
 * symbols and must be overwritten to do the non-secure/secure transition and
 * call the corresponding platform function from secure world:
 *
 * | Secure peripheral |                                Platform functions to overwrite                                |
 * |-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * |       CMU         | CMU_ClockEnable, EMU_DCDCSetPFMXTimeoutMaxCtrl (DCDC access: SL_TRUSTZONE_PERIPHERAL_DCDC_S)  |
 * |       HFXO        | CMU_HFXOCTuneSet, CMU_HFXOCTuneGet, CMU_HFXOCoreBiasCurrentCalibrate                          |
 * |       PRS         | PRS_SourceAsyncSignalSet, PRS_GetFreeChannel, PRS_ConnectConsumer, PRS_PinOutput, PRS_Combine |
 *
 * When there is a combination of secure and non-secure peripherals, defines
 * must be added in secure application slcp file so non-secure peripherals can
 * properly accessed by secure code. Example with only CMU non-secure:
 *
 * @code{.slcp}
 * define:
